  "body": "### Welcome to the Joint Research Cooperation Lab AlPS\r\nAlPS - Analytics, Privacy, and Security for IoT and Big Data - is a joint research lab  between researchers in TU Wien, Uni Linz and HoChiMinh City University of Technology. The lab receives partially funding from ASEA-UNINET for research visits and training. \r\n\r\nThe lab will be the first attempt on investigating how experts from Austria and Vietnam would come to a\r\njoint force to investigate novel techniques for analytics, security and privacy in IoT and big data for\r\nimportant application domains in Vietnam and Austria, in particular smart agriculture and smart city. We\r\nenvisage that the outcomes from this lab will be substantial contributions to smarter solutions for developing\r\nenvironments, like in Vietnam, through novel research results as well as knowledge transfer among different\r\ninvolved institutions.\r\n\r\n### Research Topics and Activities\r\nWithin the current funding phase proposed in this proposal, the lab will focus on:\r\n* Research and develop roadmaps on analytics, security and privacy issues for IoT and big data analytics for scenarios in Vietnam\r\n* Exploit potential training opportunities in analytics, privacy and security for IoT and big data\r\n* Network and establish potential collaboration with other researchers to develop a long term vision and goals for this research lab\r\n\r\nThe long term vision and goals will be developed with a focus on an excellent research lab for analytics, privacy, and security in IoT and big data for the domains of smart agriculture and cities\r\n\r\n### Members\r\n* [Hong-Linh Truong](http://dsg.tuwien.ac.at/staff/truong), TU Wien, Principal Investigator, Speaker\r\n* [Josef Kueng] (http://www.jku.at/faw/content/e233808/index_html?t=2&emp=e233808/employee_groups_wiss233822/employees233833), Uni Linz, Co-principal Investigator, \r\n* [Nam Thoai](http://www.cse.hcmut.edu.vn/~nam/), HCMUT, Co-principal Investigator\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n[Hong-Linh Truong](mailto:truong@dsg.tuwien.ac.at) ",
